        If you don’t already know — I’m Alisha Jain.
      </h2>

      <p>
        I’m a bioengineering student at UC Riverside with a deep interest in how people experience technology —
        not just how it functions, but how it feels.
      </p>

      <p>
        My background lives at the intersection of engineering, healthcare, and creative storytelling.
        I’ve worked on computational modeling projects, biomechanics research, and data-driven tools —
        but I’m equally drawn to designing calm, human-centered digital spaces that don’t overwhelm the people using them.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe the internet doesn’t have to feel loud, cold, or transactional.
        Thoughtful design, clear structure, and emotional awareness can coexist with technical rigor —
        and that balance is what I try to bring into everything I build.
      </p>

    <!-- What drives me -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h3 class="about-subhead">what drives my work</h3>

      <p>
        I’m especially interested in projects that sit close to real people and real impact —
        whether that’s modeling physiological systems, building tools that support mental health,
        or crafting interfaces that feel intuitive and grounding.
      </p>

      <p>
        My engineering work has trained me to think in systems, constraints, and trade-offs.
        My creative work reminds me that clarity, pacing, and tone matter just as much as performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        When those two mindsets come together, the result is work that’s both technically sound
        and genuinely considerate of the human on the other side of the screen.

    <!-- Outside the code -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h3 class="about-subhead">outside of work</h3>

      <p>
        Outside of engineering and coding, I spend time painting, journaling, curating playlists,
        and working on narrative game projects rooted in nostalgia and healing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m drawn to warm aesthetics, Studio Ghibli atmospheres, early-2000s internet culture,
        and design details that feel intentional but unfussy.
        Those influences quietly shape how I approach both my creative and technical projects.
